### Hello from beautiful Salt Spring Island 🌲⛰️🌊

I'm Graham, a **web developer** and **game developer** based in British Columbia, Canada.  

I work with _web technologies_ such as **React, Tailwind, Astro and NextJs** from a foundation of **HTML, CSS and Javascript** knowledge.  

I also work in _game development_, adding audio to **Unity** games with the help of the **C#** programming language and the **FMOD** middleware.
